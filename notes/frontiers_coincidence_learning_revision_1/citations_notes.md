Basal dendrites in the prefrontal cortexmof macaque monkeys vs occipital, parietal, and temporal lobe. Much greater number of spines in layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex.
Role of variability?

[@Elston1997] :

The relatively large, complex, spine-dense dendritic fields of layer III pyramidal cells in rostral (further towards "the nose") areas of the occipitoparietal (dorsal) pathway allow these cells to sample a greater number of more diverse inputs in comparison with cells in ‘lower’ areas of the proposed hierarchy.

[@Funahashi1989] :

Neurons in different cortical regions can encode different things...I guess??

[@Fuster1973] :

Temporal correlations between prefrontal unit firing and delayed-response trials are viewed as manifestations of a functional involvement by neurons of the prefrontal cortex in delayed-response performance.

[@Elston2003] :

Pyramidal neurons in different cortical regions have distinct structure, one of which is that neurons in areas that process more complex sensory features (e.g. V4 as compared to V1) show a much greater number of basal dendritic spines in the basal tree.

Anatomical differences in pyramidal neurons between Rhesus monkeys and mice and within Rhesus cortex, but not so much withing mouse cortex.
