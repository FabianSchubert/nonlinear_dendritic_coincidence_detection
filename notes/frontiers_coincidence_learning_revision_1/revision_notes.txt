## Reviewer 1

Q5:

We took the suggested publications into considerations and added a section in
the discussion addressing the role of neural variability,
see Sect. 4.2.

## Reviewer 2

- We ran a spell checker.

- L. 57: We replaced "subsuming" with "representing".

- L. 58-74: We extended the explanation regarding the motivation
            of our neuron model, including the input currents
            and the overall time scale.

- Figure 1: Fixed the typo and modified the explanation regarding alpha.

- L. 77: changed "viz" to "that is"

- L. 87-89: Referenced the respective protocols for x_d

- L. 96-106: We added further explanations regarding our choice of the target
    means of I_p and I_d.

- L. 96-98: By "averaging out", we wanted to stress the fact that I_p and I_d
        will be zero on average over time, while fluctuations are still present.
        We hope that the changes make this more clear.
        
- L. 111-120: We further explained the more general idea of dual homeostasis,
            offering a potential explanation for the issue of calculating
            squared membrane potentials.

- L. 130-137: Discussed the averaging time scale of the Hebbian rule.

- L. 190: (0,1)^N -> each entry drawn uniformly from [0,1].

- L. 192: "random Gaussian variables" -> Gaussian random variables.

- L. 211: "to the halfway point" -> to the point halfway between

- L. 222: "The workhorse of the brain, pyramidal neurons,
        possess" -> Pyramidal neurons in the brain
        possess
- L. Capitalized "German Research Foundation"
